I have had the pleasure of reading The Essence of Software by Daniel Jackson so far this summer. He talks about the importance of concepts in software design. This post will talk about what he means by concepts, why they are the single most important aspect of software design, and then we'll apply his theory by discussing some examples of software design concepts.
