The first version of this website was largely modeled after a particular website so I could have a base design and a solid foundation for my code. I then jumped in and revamped some things to my liking. I'm going to discuss how this site was made, the technology used to create it, and the direction I would like to take my personal digital garden/portfolio website.

## Built With Astro

There really isn't a better web framework for building fast and beautiful websites. The community for Astro is a huge advantage for this static site generator/web framework as it contains many plugins, templates, and there are countless projects to research to model your project after. Astro just makes things so easy and since it uses the island architecture for interactivity, it ships HTML to the browser and makes your website killer fast.
