I have made a few applications in Flask over the years, but I have yet to sit down and fully explore the intricacies of the Flask framework. I've always wanted to complete the [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/index), which is the gold standard for learning Flask. I talk about the tutorial in the post and some of the key things I've picked up by finally completing this wonderful tutorial.

## The Flask Mega Tutorial Overview

For those of you who have never heard of the Flask Mega Tutorial, it is a 20-part tutorial that teaches you the entire Flask framework by building a micro-blogging application. The author of the tutorial, Miguel Grinberg, initially posted this full-length walk through on his blog and it has since been adapted into book format that can be purchased. It is probably one of the most complete and greatest web development tutorials you will find on the web for any language and web development framework.

It begins with building the standard "Hello, World!" application, using the Python Flask framework. It then spins off into separate blog posts for specific topics, such as using templates, hooking up a database, web forms, and much more. Each blog post goes into great depth on each topic and will make you a Flask pro when you complete the entire course.

I highly recommend that you try this tutorial out, even if you don't think you need to know Flask. I think you can learn more than just how to use Python Flask by following the tutorial. You can learn some programming concepts for web development, how to structure a full-length tutorial in case you ever want to write one, and it also is teaches you good practices for creating a web application.

## Things I Learned Completing the Mega Tutorial

Some of the biggest things I picked up by going through the tutorial went beyond just learning the Flask framework. The first thing that it helped me with is how to approach developing a full-stack application with any framework. Sometimes it is hard to know what steps to take when you create an application from scratch - you often think you can just start building pages and the thing will quickly just lop together. Miguel's method of teaching you the framework while building the application also helps you understand how the various components come together in the app and it has helped me understand how I should plan for building my own full stack apps in the future.

Another thing I picked up by going through the tutorial was how to correctly write out a tutorial for building an application for somebody who has never used the framework that you are writing about. He goes in depth about each topic, but he doesn't overkill you with too much information. Sometimes blog posts don't give you enough depth on each topic, or they beat a dead horse by talking too much about some topics and not enough about other topics. I learned how to have a nice balance when you are writing a full-length tutorial.

Finally, I learned that you can really elevate yourself into developer stardom by creating a very useful tutorial. We often underestimate the value of an in-depth, full stack app tutorial and how much you can learn from a very well written and well-structured tutorial. So many tutorials make it easy to just copy and paste the code into your development environment, causing you to miss out on learning the actual principles that are being talked about. Grinberg does a great job of teaching you how to create an app without boring you to death or depriving the reader of information.

## Final Thoughts on the Flask Mega Tutorial

I am grateful that I took the time to sit down and actually go through the tutorial step by step and read through each post. I feel like I could actually go out and build a Flask app on my own now, something I wasn't confident I could do in the past. I have done numerous Flask tutorials, only to be discouraged when something didn't go right in the code or I got bored halfway through. 

I highly recommend that any aspiring Python web developer takes the time to go through Miguel's awesome tutorial and completes the entire walk through. Take notes as you need, but pay attention to the core content in his posts as it will teach you the Flask framework, unlike anyone else can.
